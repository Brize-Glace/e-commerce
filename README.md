# e-commerce

This project marks my debut in the realm of e-commerce. I've chosen to leverage TypeScript and ReflowHQ technologies for its development. Additionally, I plan to integrate Stripe for payment processing in the future.

## Project Overview

This project is an e-commerce website developed as part of my programming journey. It aims to apply my front-end web development skills while delving into the realm of online retail.
This project is still under development.

## Technologies Used

- HTML & CSS
- TypeScript

## Planned Future Changes

I plan to transition from CSS to SCSS for better organization and scalability in the styling of the project. Additionally, there's a possibility of exploring SASS for further enhancements later on.
